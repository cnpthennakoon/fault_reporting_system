            <p> A major change that has occurred in the Western family is an increased incidence in divorce.
                Whereas in the past, divorce was a relatively rare occurrence, in recent times it has become
                quite commonplace. This change is borne out clearly in census figures. For example thirty years
                ago in Australia, only one marriage in ten ended in divorce; nowadays the figure is more than one
                in three (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996: p.45). A consequence of this change has been a substantial
                increase in the number of single parent families and the attendant problems that this brings (Kilmartin, 1997).
